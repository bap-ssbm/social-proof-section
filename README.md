### What I learned

This is my first project with Tailwind, a practice project I guess, I learned alot. I've never looked at any tutorials, I'm already very familiar with CSS and used bootstrap before, so it was easy for me to learn.
I just looked at the docs on the Tailwind website. Took longer than expected, but in the future hopefuly that process will be faster. It was actually fun learning it!

```html
 <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold leading-none mb-8">10,000+ of our users love our products.</h1>
```

hard to pinpoint which one im proud of, because im really new to tailwind, but i found this to be my best one, since its so simple. Its like a mix of what i learned.
```css
.w-1000{
    width:1000px;
}

.h-250{
    height:250px;
}
@media (max-width:768px) {
    .w-1000{
        width:100%;
    }
    .h-250{
        height:auto;
    }
    
}
```
created a custom css for height and width of the containers to make it look more visually appealing



### Continued development

Build more projects with tailwind in the future!
